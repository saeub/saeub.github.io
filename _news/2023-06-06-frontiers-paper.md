- We developed and tested a mobile app for testing the comprehensibility of texts using multiple-choice questions and ratings.
- The app is optimized for users with intellectual disabilities.
- We conducted a study comparing the app to a paper-and-pencil test.
- The results show no effect on comprehension and ratings, but the participants read texts more quickly when using the mobile app compared to paper.
