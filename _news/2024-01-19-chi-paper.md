- We conducted a comprehensibility study of automatically and manually simplified German texts with persons with and without intellectual disabilities (e.g., Down syndrome).
- We measured reading comprehension using multiple-choice questions, perceived difficulty using ratings, and reading speed.
- The results show that people with and without intellectual disabilities do not perceive the texts equally, and that their reading beavior is different.
- Overall, the manually simplified texts were easier to understand than the automatically simplified texts.

The paper was accepted for a presentation at the [ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI)](https://chi2024.acm.org/) in Honolulu (Hawai'i, USA). I will attend the conference remotely.
