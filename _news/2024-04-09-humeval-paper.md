- We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of an automatic text simplification (ATS) system, including persons with and without intellectual disabilities, experts, and post-editors.
- We investigated the effect of ATS on comprehension, perception, and post-editing effort.
- The results often differ between the different stakeholders and give us a more complete picture of the quality of ATS output.

The paper was accepted for an oral presentation at the [The 4th Workshop on Human Evaluation of NLP Systems (HumEval)](https://humeval.github.io/) at LREC-COLING in Turin (Italy) on May 21, 2024.

Preprint coming soon.
