- We participated in the [GermEval Shared Task on Statement Segmentation in German Easy Language (StaGE)](https://german-easy-to-read.github.io/statements/).
- We used a BERT-based model combined with dependency parsing to identify statements in sentences in German Easy Language.
- In our paper, we outline the challenges with this task and discuss the usefulness of detecting statements in Easy Language.

We will present our submission at the workshop co-located with [KONVENS 2024](https://konvens-2024.univie.ac.at/) in Vienna (Austria) on September 13, 2024.
