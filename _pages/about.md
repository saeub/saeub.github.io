Hi there! I'm a PhD student working on cognitively inspired NLP with eye tracking at [MaiNLP lab](https://mainlp.github.io/) (LMU Munich), supervised by [Barbara Plank](https://bplank.github.io/) and [Diego Frassinelli](https://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/personen/mitarbeiter/frassinelli/index.html). Previously, I was a master's student in Computational Linguistics and Neuroinformatics at the University of Zurich, where I mainly worked on text simplification and (human and machine) reading comprehension.

Some of my research interests:

- **Cognitive plausibility:** How can we make NLP models more human-like?
- **Eye tracking:** How can we use human gaze data to improve or evaluate NLP models?
- **Human-centered evaluation:** How can we measure the usefulness of NLP models?
- **Interdisciplinary research:** What can NLP learn from linguistics, cognitive science, education, and other fields?
