Hi there! I'm Andreas. I like humans, languages, and computers (in that order). I'm a Master's student in Computational Linguistics and Neuroinformatics at the University of Zurich. I also have a Bachelor's degree in Computational Linguistics and Comparative Linguistics.

Currently, I'm most interested in human-centric natural language processing, including human evaluation, language technology for accessibility, and computational psycholinguistics. My research so far has focused on text simplification and its evaluation. I love learning and teaching what I've learned to others.
